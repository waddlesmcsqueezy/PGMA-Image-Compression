# PGMA-Image-Compression

This project was to test the effects of quad tree traversal compression on PGMA images. After performing the quad tree traversal with variance thresholds, we were to ZIP the files using LZ compression to observe the differences in file sizes. Below is the report written. PGMA images contain a space separated value list of gray levels, therefore they are easy to directly manipulate via C. The program will create quad trees recursively and compare the variance of the current quad it is working on, and if it is higher than the allowed variance, the entire quad will be changed to the mean of the entire quad.

      Original Baboon.pgma	            1230kb	                                      287kb
      Output @ 0 variance	              1272kb	                                      287kb
      Output @ 16 variance	            1272kb	                                      283kb
      Output @ 64 variance	            1273kb	                                      252kb
      Output @ 256 variance	            1272kb	                                      192kb


Interestingly, the size before we use LZ compression on the quad tree processed image, they are bigger by about 40kb across all levels of compression (probably comes down to inefficiency of the programâ€™s use of whitespace), but after LZ compression, the higher compression level in the program, the smaller the file size. This is likely due to LZ compression making use of duplicate data in the file like 2 pixels being the same color etc.
