# PGMA-Image-Compression

This project was to test the effects of quad tree traversal compression on PGMA images which contain a space separated value list of gray levels, therefore they are easy to directly manipulate via C.

Interestingly, the size before we use LZ compression on the quad tree processed image, they are bigger by about 40kb across all levels of compression (probably comes down to inefficiency of the programâ€™s use of whitespace), but after LZ compression, the higher compression level in the program, the smaller the file size. This is likely due to LZ compression making use of duplicate data in the file like 2 pixels being the same color etc.
